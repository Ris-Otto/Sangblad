A meta file will be added for each .tex document.
The file will have the following properties:

	- Structure: Book|Leaflet
	- Title: Document title
	- Songs: [song_title - song_num - page_num - line_start - line_stop]
	- Chapters: [chapter_title - chapter_num - page_num - line_start - line_stop]

The meta file will be updated everytime the document is updated.

Book:

	- Each section should end with a \newpage command

Leaflet:

	- something


Each separate new document is added to either a directory in "Books/" or "Leaflets/"
depending on user input.

All the relevant items required for the document to compile should reside in this directory.
For the document to be parsed the directory should have the following structure(default):

	- Scores: This directory will contain any scores used in the document

	- Chapters: This directory will contain all the chapters used in the document.
		    For leaflets this will probably be a singular chapter

	- document_title.meta: This file will contain information about the file and its structure.
			       The file is created with the document, or created when reading a
			       compatible document.

	- document_title-main.tex: The main .tex file, which should be the only runnable .tex file
				   in the directory.

	- For your convenience, you could consider adding your non-TeX text files in a sub-directory here as well.
